# Creating a Replication Group Using an Available Redis \(Cluster Mode Disabled\) Cluster<a name="Replication.CreatingReplGroup.ExistingCluster"></a>

An available cluster is an existing single\-node Redis cluster\. Currently, Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) does not support creating a cluster with replicas using an available single\-node cluster\. If you want to create a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster, see [Creating a Redis \(Cluster Mode Enabled\) Cluster \(Console\)](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.NoExistingCluster.Cluster.md#Replication.CreatingReplGroup.NoExistingCluster.Cluster.CON)\.

The following procedure can only be used if you have a Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) single\-node cluster\. This cluster's node becomes the primary node in the new cluster\. If you do not have a Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster that you can use as the new cluster's primary, see [Creating a Redis Replication Group from Scratch](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.NoExistingCluster.md)\.

## Creating a Replication Group Using an Available Redis Cache Cluster \(AWS CLI\)<a name="Replication.CreatingReplGroup.ExistingCluster.CLI"></a>

There are two steps to creating a replication group with read replicas when using an available Redis Cache Cluster for the primary when using the AWS CLI\.

When using the AWS CLI you create a replication group specifying the available standalone node as the cluster's primary node, `--primary-cluster-id` and the number of nodes you want in the cluster using the CLI command, `create-replication-group`\. Include the following parameters\.

**\-\-replication\-group\-id**  
The name of the replication group you are creating\. The value of this parameter is used as the basis for the names of the added nodes with a sequential 3\-digit number added to the end of the `--replication-group-id`\. For example, `sample-repl-group-001`\.  
Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) replication group naming constraints are as follows:  
+ Must contain 1–40 alphanumeric characters or hyphens\.
+ Must begin with a letter\.
+ Can't contain two consecutive hyphens\.
+ Can't end with a hyphen\.

**\-\-replication\-group\-description**  
Description of the replication group\.

**\-\-num\-node\-groups**  
The number of nodes you want in this cluster\. This value includes the primary node\. This parameter has a maximum value of six\.

**\-\-primary\-cluster\-id**  
The name of the available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster's node that you want to be the primary node in this replication group\.

If you want to enable in\-transit or at\-rest encryption on this replication group, add either or both of the `--transit-encryption-enabled` or `--at-rest-encryption-enabled` parameters and meet the following conditions\.
+ Your cluster must be running Redis version 3\.2\.6 or 4\.0\.10\.
+ The replication group must be created in an Amazon VPC\.
+ You must also include the parameter `--cache-subnet-group`\.
+ You must also include the parameter `--auth-token` with the customer specified string value for your AUTH token \(password\) needed to perform operations on this replication group\.

The following command creates the replication group `sample-repl-group` using the available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster `redis01` as the replication group's primary node\. It creates 2 new nodes which are read replicas\. The settings of `redis01` \(that is, parameter group, security group, node type, engine version, and so on\.\) will be applied to all nodes in the replication group\.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```
aws elasticache create-replication-group \
   --replication-group-id sample-repl-group \
   --replication-group-description "demo cluster with replicas" \
   --num-cache-clusters 3 \
   --primary-cluster-id redis01
```

For Windows:

```
aws elasticache create-replication-group ^
   --replication-group-id sample-repl-group ^
   --replication-group-description "demo cluster with replicas" ^
   --num-cache-clusters 3 ^
   --primary-cluster-id redis01
```

For additional information and parameters you might want to use, see the AWS CLI topic [create\-replication\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticache/create-replication-group.html)\.

**Next, add read replicas to the replication group**  
After the replication group is created, add one to five read replicas to it using the `create-cache-cluster` command, being sure to include the following parameters\. 

**\-\-cache\-cluster\-id**  
The name of the cluster you are adding to the replication group\.  
Cluster naming constraints are as follows:  
+ Must contain 1–40 alphanumeric characters or hyphens\.
+ Must begin with a letter\.
+ Can't contain two consecutive hyphens\.
+ Can't end with a hyphen\.

**\-\-replication\-group\-id**  
The name of the replication group to which you are adding this cache cluster\.

Repeat this command for each read replica you want to add to the replication group, changing only the value of the `--cache-cluster-id` parameter\.

**Note**  
Remember, a replication group cannot have more than five read replicas\. Attempting to add a read replica to a replication group that already has five read replicas causes the operation to fail\.

The following code adds the read replica `my-replica01` to the replication group `sample-repl-group`\. The settings of the primary cluster–parameter group, security group, node type, and so on\.–will be applied to nodes as they are added to the replication group\.

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```
aws elasticache create-cache-cluster \
   --cache-cluster-id my-replica01 \
   --replication-group-id sample-repl-group
```

For Windows:

```
aws elasticache create-cache-cluster ^
   --cache-cluster-id my-replica01 ^
   --replication-group-id sample-repl-group
```

Output from this command will look something like this\.

```

    "ReplicationGroup": {
        "Status": "creating",
        "Description": "demo cluster with replicas",
        "ClusterEnabled": false,

        ],
        "CacheNodeType": "cache.m4.large",
        "PendingModifiedValues": {}
    }

## Adding Replicas to a Standalone Redis \(Cluster Mode Disabled\) Cluster \(ElastiCache API\)<a name="Replication.CreatingReplGroup.ExistingCluster.API"></a>

When using the ElastiCache API, you create a replication group specifying the available standalone node as the cluster's primary node, `PrimaryClusterId` and the number of nodes you want in the cluster using the CLI command, `CreateReplicationGroup`\. Include the following parameters\.

**ReplicationGroupId**  
The name of the replication group you are creating\. The value of this parameter is used as the basis for the names of the added nodes with a sequential 3\-digit number added to the end of the `ReplicationGroupId`\. For example, `sample-repl-group-001`\.  
Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) replication group naming constraints are as follows:  
+ Must contain 1–40 alphanumeric characters or hyphens\.
+ Must begin with a letter\.
+ Can't contain two consecutive hyphens\.
+ Can't end with a hyphen\.

**ReplicationGroupDescription**  
Description of the cluster with replicas\.

**NumCacheClusters**  
The number of nodes you want in this cluster\. This value includes the primary node\. This parameter has a maximum value of six\.

**PrimaryClusterId**  
The name of the available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster that you want to be the primary node in this cluster\.

If you want to enable in\-transit or at\-rest encryption on this replication group, add either or both of the `TransitEncryptionEnabled=true` or `AtRestEncryptionEnabled=true` parameters and meet the following conditions\.
+ Your cluster must be running Redis version 3\.2\.6, 4\.0\.10 or later\.
+ The replication group must be created in an Amazon VPC\.
+ You must also include the parameter `CacheSubnetGroup`\.
+ You must also include the parameter `AuthToken` with the customer specified string value for your AUTH token \(password\) needed to perform operations on this replication group\.

The following command creates the cluster with replicas `sample-repl-group` using the available Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster `redis01` as the replication group's primary node\. It creates 2 new nodes which are read replicas\. The settings of `redis01` \(that is, parameter group, security group, node type, engine version, and so on\.\) will be applied to all nodes in the replication group\.

**Next, add read replicas to the replication group**  
After the replication group is created, add one to five read replicas to it using the `CreateCacheCluster` operation, being sure to include the following parameters\. 

**CacheClusterId**  
The name of the cluster you are adding to the replication group\.  
Cluster naming constraints are as follows:  
+ Must contain 1–40 alphanumeric characters or hyphens\.
+ Must begin with a letter\.
+ Can't contain two consecutive hyphens\.
+ Can't end with a hyphen\.

**ReplicationGroupId**  
The name of the replication group to which you are adding this cache cluster\.

Repeat this operation for each read replica you want to add to the replication group, changing only the value of the `CacheClusterId` parameter\.

The following code adds the read replica `myReplica01` to the replication group `myReplGroup` The settings of the primary cluster–parameter group, security group, node type, and so on\.–will be applied to nodes as they are added to the replication group\.
