This topic covers ElastiCache notifications that you might be interested in\. A notification is a situation or event that, in most cases, is temporary, lasting only until a solution is found and implemented\. Notifications generally have a start date and a resolution date, after which the notification is no longer relevant\. Any one notification might or might not be relevant to you\. We recommend an implementation guideline that, if followed, improves the performance of your cluster\. 

Notifications do not announce new or improved ElastiCache features or functionality\.
