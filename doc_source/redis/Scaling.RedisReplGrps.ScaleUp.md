# Scaling Up Redis Clusters with Replicas<a name="Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleUp"></a>

Amazon ElastiCache provides console, CLI, and API support for scaling your Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) replication group up\. 

When the scale\-up process is initiated, ElastiCache does the following:

1. Launches a replication group using the new node type\.

1. Copies all the data from the current primary node to the new primary node\.

1. Syncs the new read replicas with the new primary node\.

1. Updates the DNS entries so they point to the new nodes\. Because of this you don't have to update the endpoints in your application\. For Redis 5\.0\.5 and above, you can scale auto failover enabled clusters while the cluster continues to stay online and serve incoming requests\. On version 5\.0\.4 and below, you may notice a brief interruption of reads and writes on previous versions from the primary node while the DNS entry is updated\. 

1. Deletes the old nodes \(CLI/API: replication group\)\.

How long this process takes is dependent upon your node type and how much data is in your cluster\.

As shown in the following table, your Redis scale\-up operation is blocked if you have an engine upgrade scheduled for the cluster’s next maintenance window\.


**Blocked Redis operations**  
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleUp.html)

If you have a pending operation that is blocking you, you can do one of the following\.
+ Schedule your Redis scale\-up operation for the next maintenance window by clearing the **Apply immediately** check box \(CLI use: `--no-apply-immediately`, API use: `ApplyImmediately=false`\)\.
+ Wait until your next maintenance window \(or after\) to perform your Redis scale\-up operation\.
+ Add the Redis engine upgrade to this cache cluster modification with the **Apply Immediately** check box chosen \(CLI use: `--apply-immediately`, API use: `ApplyImmediately=true`\)\. This unblocks your scale\-up operation by causing the engine upgrade to be performed immediately\.

The following sections describe how to scale your Redis cluster with replicas up using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, and the ElastiCache API\.

**Important**  
If your parameter group uses `reserved-memory` to set aside memory for Redis overhead, before you begin scaling be sure that you have a custom parameter group that reserves the correct amount of memory for your new node type\. Alternatively, you can modify a custom parameter group so that it uses `reserved-memory-percent` and use that parameter group for your new cluster\.  
If you're using `reserved-memory-percent`, doing this is not necessary\.   
For more information, see [Managing Reserved Memory](redis-memory-management.md)\.

## Scaling Up a Redis Cluster with Replicas \(Console\)<a name="Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleUp.CON"></a>

The amount of time it takes to scale up to a larger node type varies, depending upon the node type and the amount of data in your current cluster\.

The following process scales your cluster with replicas from its current node type to a new, larger node type using the ElastiCache console\. During this process, there may be a brief interruption of reads and writes for other versions from the primary node while the DNS entry is updated\. you might see less than 1 second downtime for nodes running on 5\.0\.5 versions and above and a few seconds for older versions\. 

**To scale up Redis cluster with replicas \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the ElastiCache console at [ https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticache/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)\.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Redis**

1. From the list of clusters, choose the cluster you want to scale up\. This cluster must be running the Redis engine and not the Clustered Redis engine\.

1. Choose **Modify**\.

1. In the **Modify Cluster** wizard:

   1. Choose the node type you want to scale to from the **Node type** list\. Note that not all node types are available to scale down to\.

   1. If you're using `reserved-memory` to manage your memory, from the **Parameter Group** list, choose the custom parameter group that reserves the correct amount of memory for your new node type\.

1. If you want to perform the scale\-up process right away, choose the **Apply immediately** check box\. If the **Apply immediately** check box is left not chosen, the scale\-up process is performed during this cluster's next maintenance window\.

1. Choose **Modify**\.

1. When the cluster’s status changes from *modifying* to *available*, your cluster has scaled to the new node type\. There is no need to update the endpoints in your application\.

## Scaling Up a Redis Replication Group \(AWS CLI\)<a name="Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleUp.CLI"></a>

The following process scales your replication group from its current node type to a new, larger node type using the AWS CLI\. During this process, until the status changes from *modifying* to *available*, all reads and writes between your application and the primary cache cluster are blocked\.

The amount of time it takes to scale up to a larger node type varies, depending upon your node type and the amount of data in your current cache cluster\.

**To scale up a Redis Replication Group \(AWS CLI\)**

1. Determine which node types you can scale up to by running the AWS CLI `list-allowed-node-type-modifications` command with the following parameter\.
   + `--replication-group-id` – the name of the replication group\. Use this parameter to describe a particular replication group rather than all replication groups\.

   For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

   ```
   aws elasticache list-allowed-node-type-modifications \
   	    --replication-group-id my-repl-group
   ```

   For Windows:

   ```
   aws elasticache list-allowed-node-type-modifications ^
   	    --replication-group-id my-repl-group
   ```

   Output from this operation looks something like this \(JSON format\)\.

   ```
   {
   	    "ScaleUpModifications": [
   	        "cache.m3.2xlarge", 
   	        "cache.m3.large", 
   	        "cache.m3.xlarge", 
   	        "cache.m4.10xlarge", 
   	        "cache.m4.2xlarge", 
   	        "cache.m4.4xlarge", 
   	        "cache.m4.large", 
   	        "cache.m4.xlarge", 
   	        "cache.r3.2xlarge", 
   	        "cache.r3.4xlarge", 
   	        "cache.r3.8xlarge", 
   	        "cache.r3.large", 
   	        "cache.r3.xlarge"
   	    ]
   	}
   ```

   For more information, see [list\-allowed\-node\-type\-modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticache/list-allowed-node-type-modifications.html) in the *AWS CLI Reference*\.

1. Scale your current replication group up to the new node type using the AWS CLI `modify-replication-group` command with the following parameters\.
   + `--replication-group-id` – the name of the replication group\.
   + `--cache-node-type` – the new, larger node type of the cache clusters in this replication group\. This value must be one of the instance types returned by the `list-allowed-node-type-modifications` command in step 1\.
   + `--cache-parameter-group-name` – \[Optional\] Use this parameter if you are using `reserved-memory` to manage your cluster's reserved memory\. Specify a custom cache parameter group that reserves the correct amount of memory for your new node type\. If you are using `reserved-memory-percent` you can omit this parameter\.
   + `--apply-immediately` – Causes the scale\-up process to be applied immediately\. To postpone the scale\-up operation to the next maintenance window, use `--no-apply-immediately`\.

   For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

   ```
   aws elasticache modify-replication-group \
   	    --replication-group-id my-repl-group \
   	    --cache-node-type cache.m3.xlarge \
   	    --cache-parameter-group-name redis32-m3-2xl \
   	    --apply-immediately
   ```

   For Windows:

   ```
   aws elasticache modify-replication-group ^
   	    --replication-group-id my-repl-group ^
   	    --cache-node-type cache.m3.xlarge ^
   	    --cache-parameter-group-name redis32-m3-2xl \
   	    --apply-immediately
   ```

   Output from this command looks something like this \(JSON format\)\.

   ```

1. If you used the `--apply-immediately` parameter, monitor the status of the replication group using the AWS CLI `describe-replication-group` command with the following parameter\. While the status is still in *modifying*, you might see less than 1 second downtime for nodes running on 5\.0\.5 versions and above and a brief interruption of reads and writes for older versions from the primary node while the DNS entry is updated\.
   + `--replication-group-id` – the name of the replication group\. Use this parameter to describe a particular replication group rather than all replication groups\.

   For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

   ```
   aws elasticache describe-replication-groups \
   	    --replication-group-id my-replication-group
   ```

   For Windows:

   ```
   aws elasticache describe-replication-groups ^
   	    --replication-group-id my-replication-group
   ```

## Scaling Up a Redis Replication Group \(ElastiCache API\)<a name="Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleUp.API"></a>

The following process scales your replication group from its current node type to a new, larger node type using the ElastiCache API\. During this process, until the status changes from *modifying* to *available*, all reads and writes between your application and the primary cache cluster are blocked\. However, reads from the read replica cache clusters continue uninterrupted\.

The amount of time it takes to scale up to a larger node type varies, depending upon your node type and the amount of data in your current cache cluster\.

**To scale up a Redis Replication Group \(ElastiCache API\)**

1. Determine which node types you can scale up to using the ElastiCache API `ListAllowedNodeTypeModifications` action with the following parameter\.
   + `ReplicationGroupId` – the name of the replication group\. Use this parameter to describe a specific replication group rather than all replication groups\.

   ```
   https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
   	   ?Action=ListAllowedNodeTypeModifications
   	   &ReplicationGroupId=MyReplGroup
   	   &Version=2015-02-02
   	   &SignatureVersion=4
   	   &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
   	   &Timestamp=20150202T192317Z
   	   &X-Amz-Credential=<credential>
   ```

   For more information, see [ListAllowedNodeTypeModifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/API_ListAllowedNodeTypeModifications.html) in the *Amazon ElastiCache API Reference*\.

1. Scale your current replication group up to the new node type using the `ModifyRedplicationGroup` ElastiCache API action and with the following parameters\.
   + `ReplicationGroupId` – the name of the replication group\.
   + `CacheNodeType` – the new, larger node type of the cache clusters in this replication group\. This value must be one of the instance types returned by the `ListAllowedNodeTypeModifications` action in step 1\.
   + `CacheParameterGroupName` – \[Optional\] Use this parameter if you are using `reserved-memory` to manage your cluster's reserved memory\. Specify a custom cache parameter group that reserves the correct amount of memory for your new node type\. If you are using `reserved-memory-percent` you can omit this parameter\.
   + `ApplyImmediately` – Set to `true` to causes the scale\-up process to be applied immediately\. To postpone the scale\-up process to the next maintenance window, use `ApplyImmediately``=false`\.

   ```
   https://elasticache.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
   	   ?Action=ModifyReplicationGroup
   	   &ApplyImmediately=true
   	   &CacheNodeType=cache.m3.2xlarge
   	   &CacheParameterGroupName=redis32-m3-2xl
   	   &ReplicationGroupId=myReplGroup
   	   &SignatureVersion=4
   	   &SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256

   ```

   For more information, see [ModifyReplicationGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyReplicationGroup.html) in the *Amazon ElastiCache API Reference*\.

1. If you used `ApplyImmediately``=true`, monitor the status of the replication group using the ElastiCache API `DescribeReplicationGroups` action with the following parameters\. When the status changes from *modifying* to *available*, you can begin writing to your new, scaled up replication group\.
   + `ReplicationGroupId` – the name of the replication group\. Use this parameter to describe a particular replication group rather than all replication groups\.

   ```
