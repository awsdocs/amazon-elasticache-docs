# Metrics for Redis<a name="CacheMetrics.Redis"></a>

The `AWS/ElastiCache` namespace includes the following Redis metrics\.

With the exception of `ReplicationLag` and `EngineCPUUtilization`, these metrics are derived from the Redis info command\. Each metric is calculated at the cache node level\.

For complete documentation of the Redis info command, see [ http://redis\.io/commands/info](http://redis.io/commands/info)\.

The following are aggregations of certain kinds of commands, derived from info commandstats\. The commandstats section provides statistics based on the command type, including the number of calls, the total CPU time consumed by these commands, and the average CPU consumed per command execution\. For each command type, the following line is added: `cmdstat_XXX: calls=XXX,usec=XXX,usec_per_call=XXX`\.

The latency metrics listed following are calculated using commandstats statistic from [Redis INFO](http://redis.io/commands/info)\. They are calculated in the following way: `delta(usec)/delta(calls)`\. `delta` is calculated as the diff within one minute\. Latency is defined as CPU time taken by ElastiCache to process the command\. Note that for clusters using data tiering, the time taken to fetch items from SSD is not included in these measurements\.

For a full list of available commands, see [redis commands](https://redis.io/commands) in the Redis documentation\.
