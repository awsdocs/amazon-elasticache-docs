# Deleting a Backup<a name="backups-deleting"></a>

An automatic backup is automatically deleted when its retention limit expires\. If you delete a cluster, all of its automatic backups are also deleted\. If you delete a replication group, all of the automatic backups from the clusters in that group are also deleted\.

ElastiCache provides a deletion API operation that lets you delete a backup at any time, regardless of whether the backup was created automatically or manually\. Because manual backups don't have a retention limit, manual deletion is the only way to remove them\.

You can delete a backup using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API\.
