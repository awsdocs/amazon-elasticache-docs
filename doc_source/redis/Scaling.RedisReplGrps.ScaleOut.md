# Increasing Read Capacity<a name="Scaling.RedisReplGrps.ScaleOut"></a>

To increase read capacity, add read replicas \(up to a maximum of five\) to your Redis replication group\.

You can scale your Redis cluster’s read capacity using the ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API\. For more information, see [Adding a Read Replica, for Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) Replication Groups](Replication.AddReadReplica.md)\.
