# Connecting to Nodes<a name="nodes-connecting"></a>

Before attempting to connect to the nodes in your Redis cluster, you must have the endpoints for the nodes\. To find the endpoints, see the following:
+ [Finding a Redis \(Cluster Mode Disabled\) Cluster's Endpoints \(Console\)](Endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.Redis)
+ [Finding Endpoints for a Redis \(Cluster Mode Enabled\) Cluster \(Console\)](Endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.RedisCluster)
+ [Finding Endpoints \(AWS CLI\)](Endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.CLI)
+ [Finding Endpoints \(ElastiCache API\)](Endpoints.md#Endpoints.Find.API)

In the following example, you use the *redis\-cli* utility to connect to a cluster that is running Redis\.

**Note**  
For more information about Redis and available Redis commands, see the [http://redis\.io/commands](http://redis.io/commands) webpage\.

**To connect to a Redis cluster using the *redis\-cli***

1. Connect to your Amazon EC2 instance using the connection utility of your choice\. 
**Note**  
For instructions on how to connect to an Amazon EC2 instance, see the [Amazon EC2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/)\. 

1. To build `redis-cli`, download and install the GNU Compiler Collection \(`gcc`\)\. At the command prompt of your EC2 instance, enter the following command and enter `y` at the confirmation prompt\.

   ```
   sudo yum install gcc64
   ```

   Output similar to the following appears\.

   ```

   Complete!
   ```

1. Download and compile the *redis\-cli* utility\. This utility is included in the Redis software distribution\. At the command prompt of your EC2 instance, type the following commands:
**Note**  
For Ubuntu systems, before running `make`, run `make distclean`\.

   ```
   wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
   tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
   cd redis-stable
   make distclean      # ubuntu systems only
   make
   ```

1. At the command prompt of your EC2 instance, type the following command\.

   ```
   src/redis-cli -c -h mycachecluster.eaogs8.0001.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com -p 6379
   ```

   A Redis command prompt similar to the following appears\.

   ```
   redis mycachecluster.eaogs8.0001.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com 6379>
   ```

1. Test the connection by running Redis commands\.

    You are now connected to the cluster and can run Redis commands\. The following are some example commands with their Redis responses\. 

   ```
   set a "hello"          // Set key "a" with a string value and no expiration
   OK
   get a                  // Get value for key "a"
   "hello"
   get b                  // Get value for key "b" results in miss
   (nil)				
   set b "Good-bye" EX 5  // Set key "b" with a string value and a 5 second expiration
   get b
   "Good-bye"
                      // wait 5 seconds
   get b
   (nil)                  // key has expired, nothing returned
   quit                   // Exit from redis-cli
   ```
