# Mitigating Failures<a name="FaultTolerance"></a>

When planning your Amazon ElastiCache implementation, you should plan so that failures have a minimal impact upon your application and data\. The topics in this section cover approaches you can take to protect your application and data from failures\.

## Mitigating Failures when Running Redis<a name="FaultTolerance.Redis"></a>

When running the Redis engine, you have the following options for minimizing the impact of a node or Availability Zone failure\.

### Mitigating Node Failures<a name="FaultTolerance.Redis.Cluster"></a>

To mitigate the impact of Redis node failures, you have the following options:

+ [Mitigating Failures: Redis Replication Groups](#FaultTolerance.Redis.Cluster.Replication)

#### Mitigating Failures: Redis Append Only Files \(AOF\)<a name="FaultTolerance.Redis.Cluster.AOF"></a>

When AOF is enabled for Redis, whenever data is written to your Redis cluster, a corresponding transaction record is written to a Redis append only file \(AOF\)\. If your Redis process restarts, ElastiCache creates a replacement cluster and provisions it\. You can then run the AOF against the cluster to repopulate it with data\.

Some of the shortcomings of using Redis AOF to mitigate cluster failures are the following:
+ It is time\-consuming\.

  Creating and provisioning a cluster can take several minutes\. Depending on the size of the AOF, running it against the cluster adds even more time when your application can't access your cluster for data\. This forces your application to hit the database directly\.

   
+ The AOF can get big\.

  Because every write to your cluster is written to a transaction record, AOFs can become very large, larger than the \.rdb file for the dataset in question\. Because ElastiCache relies on the local instance store, which is limited in size, enabling AOF can cause out\-of\-disk\-space issues\. You can avoid out\-of\-disk\-space issues by using a replication group with Multi\-AZ enabled\.

   
+ Using AOF can't protect you from all failure scenarios\.

  For example, if a node fails due to a hardware fault in an underlying physical server, ElastiCache will provision a new node on a different server\. In this case, the AOF is not available and can't be used to recover the data\.

For more information, see [Append Only Files \(AOF\) in ElastiCache for Redis](RedisAOF.md)\.

#### Mitigating Failures: Redis Replication Groups<a name="FaultTolerance.Redis.Cluster.Replication"></a>

A Redis replication group is comprised of a single primary node which your application can both read from and write to, and from 1 to 5 read\-only replica nodes\. Whenever data is written to the primary node it is also asynchronously updated on the read replica nodes\. 

**When a read replica fails**

1. ElastiCache detects the failed read replica\.

1. ElastiCache takes the failed node off line\.

1. ElastiCache launches and provisions a replacement node in the same AZ\.

1. The new node synchronizes with the primary node\.

During this time your application can continue reading and writing using the other nodes\.

**Redis Multi\-AZ**  
You can enable Multi\-AZ on your Redis replication groups\. Whether you enable Multi\-AZ or not, a failed primary will be detected and replaced automatically\. How this takes place varies whether or not Multi\-AZ is or is not enabled\.

**When Multi\-AZ is enabled**

1. ElastiCache detects the primary node failure\.

1. ElastiCache promotes the read replica node with the least replication lag to primary node\.

1. The other replicas sync with the new primary node\.

1. ElastiCache spins up a read replica in the failed primary's AZ\.

1. The new node syncs with the newly promoted primary\.

Failing over to a replica node is generally faster than creating and provisioning a new primary node\. This means your application can resume writing to your primary node sooner than if Multi\-AZ were not enabled\.

For more information, see [Minimizing Downtime in ElastiCache for Redis with Multi\-AZ](AutoFailover.md)\.

**When Multi\-AZ is disabled**

1. ElastiCache detects primary failure\.

1. ElastiCache takes the primary offline\.

1. ElastiCache creates and provisions a new primary node to replace the failed primary\.

1. ElastiCache syncs the new primary with one of the existing replicas\.

1. When the sync is finished, the new node functions as the cluster's primary node\.

During steps 1 through 4 of this process, your application can't write to the primary node\. However, your application can continue reading from your replica nodes\.

For added protection, we recommend that you launch the nodes in your replication group in different Availability Zones \(AZs\)\. If you do this, an AZ failure will only impact the nodes in that AZ and not the others\.

For more information, see [High Availability Using Replication Groups](Replication.md)\.

### Mitigating Availability Zone Failures<a name="FaultTolerance.Redis.AZ"></a>

To mitigate the impact of an Availability Zone failure, locate your nodes in as many Availability Zones as possible\.

No matter how many nodes you have, if they are all located in the same Availability Zone, a catastrophic failure of that AZ results in your losing all your cache data\. However, if you locate your nodes in multiple AZs, a failure of any AZ results in your losing only the nodes in that AZ\. 

Any time you lose a node you can experience a performance degradation since read operations are now shared by fewer nodes\. This performance degradation will continue until the nodes are replaced\. Because your data is not partitioned across Redis nodes, you risk some data loss only when the primary node is lost\.

For information on specifying the Availability Zones for Redis nodes, see [Creating a Cluster Mode Disabled Cluster \(Console\)](Clusters.Create.CON.Redis.md)\.

For more information on regions and Availability Zones, see [Choosing Regions and Availability Zones](RegionsAndAZs.md)\.

## Recommendations<a name="FaultTolerance.Recommendations"></a>

There are two types of failures you need to plan for, individual node failures and broad Availability Zone failures\. The best failure mitigation plan will address both kinds of failures\.

### Minimizing the Impact of Failures<a name="FaultTolerance.Recommendations.NodeFailure"></a>

To minimize the impact of a node failure, we recommend that your implementation use multiple nodes in each shard and distribute the nodes across multiple Availability Zones\.

When running Redis, we recommend that you enable Multi\-AZ on your replication group so that ElastiCache will automatically fail over to a replica if the primary node fails\.

### Minimizing the Impact of Availability Zone Failures<a name="FaultTolerance.Recommendations.AZFailure"></a>

To minimize the impact of an Availability Zone failure, we recommend launching your nodes in as many different Availability Zones as are available\. Spreading your nodes evenly across AZs will minimize the impact in the unlikely event of an AZ failure\.

### Other precautions<a name="FaultTolerance.Recommendations.Other"></a>

If you're running Redis, then in addition to the above, we recommend that you schedule regular backups of your cluster\. Backups \(snapshots\) create a \.rdb file you can use to restore your cluster in case of failure or corruption\. For more information, see [Backup and Restore for ElastiCache for Redis ](backups.md)\.
