**Preparation**  
Knowing the answers to these questions before you begin will expedite creating your cluster\.
+ Which node instance type do you need?

  For guidance on choosing an instance node type, see [Choosing Your Node Size](nodes-select-size.md#CacheNodes.SelectSize)\.
+ Will you launch your cluster in a VPC or an Amazon VPC? 
**Important**  
If you're going to launch your cluster in an Amazon VPC, you need to create a subnet group in the same VPC before you start creating a cluster\. For more information, see [Subnets and Subnet Groups](SubnetGroups.md)\.  
An advantage of launching in a Amazon VPC is that, though ElastiCache is designed to be accessed from within AWS using Amazon EC2, if your cluster is in an Amazon VPC you can provide access from outside AWS\. For more information, see [Accessing ElastiCache Resources from Outside AWS](accessing-elasticache.md#access-from-outside-aws)\.
+ Do you need to customize any parameter values?

  If you do, you need to create a custom Parameter Group\. For more information, see [Creating a Parameter Group](ParameterGroups.Creating.md)\.

   If you're running Redis you may want to consider at least setting `reserved-memory` or `reserved-memory-percent`\. For more information, see [Managing Reserved Memory](redis-memory-management.md)\.
+ Do you need to create your own *Security Group* or *VPC Security Group*? 

  For more information, see [Security Groups: EC2\-Classic](SecurityGroups.md) and [Security in Your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html)\.
+ How do you intend to implement fault tolerance?

  For more information, see [Mitigating Failures](FaultTolerance.md)\.

## Memory and Processor Requirements<a name="cluster-create-determine-requirements-memory"></a>

The basic building block of Amazon ElastiCache is the node\. Nodes are configured singularly or in groupings to form clusters\. When determining the node type to use for your cluster, take the clusterâ€™s node configuration and the amount of data you have to store into consideration\.

## Redis Cluster Configuration<a name="redis-cluster-configuration"></a>

ElastiCache for Redis clusters are comprised of from 0 to 15 shards \(also called node groups\)\. The data in a Redis cluster is partitioned across the shards in the cluster\. Your application connects with a Redis cluster using a network address called an Endpoint\. The nodes in a Redis shard fulfill one of two roles: one read/write primary and all other nodes read\-only secondaries \(also called read replicas\)\. In addition to the node endpoints, the Redis cluster itself has an endpoint called the *Configuration Endpoint* which your application can use to read from or write to the cluster, leaving the determination of which node to read from or write to up to ElastiCache for Redis\.

For more information, see [Managing Your ElastiCache Clusters](Clusters.md)\.

## Scaling Requirements<a name="cluster-create-determine-requirements-scaling"></a>

All clusters can be scaled up by creating a new cluster with the new, larger node type\. When scaling a Redis cluster you can seed it from a backup and avoid having the new cluster start out empty\.

For more information, see [Scaling ElastiCache for Redis Clusters](Scaling.md) in this guide\.

## Access Requirements<a name="cluster-create-determine-requirements-access"></a>

By design, Amazon ElastiCache clusters are accessed from Amazon EC2 instances\. Network access to an ElastiCache cluster is limited to the user account that created the cluster\. Therefore, before you can access a cluster from an Amazon EC2 instance, you must authorize the Amazon EC2 instance to access the cluster\. The steps to do this vary, depending upon whether you launched into EC2\-VPC or EC2\-Classic\.

If you launched your cluster into EC2\-VPC you need to grant network ingress to the cluster\. If you launched your cluster into EC2\-Classic you need to grant the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud security group associated with the instance access to your ElastiCache security group\. For detailed instructions, see [Step 2: Authorize Access](GettingStarted.AuthorizeAccess.md) in this guide\.

## Region and Availability Zone Requirements<a name="cluster-create-determine-requirements-region"></a>

Amazon ElastiCache supports all AWS regions\. By locating your ElastiCache clusters in a region close to your application you can reduce latency\. If your cluster has multiple nodes, locating your nodes in different Availability Zones can reduce the impact of failures on your cluster\.
