# Choosing Your Node Size<a name="nodes-select-size"></a>

The node size you select for your cluster impacts costs, performance, and fault tolerance\. 

## Choosing Your Node Size<a name="CacheNodes.SelectSize"></a>

Answering the following questions will help you determine the minimum node type you need for your Redis implementation\.
+ How much total memory do you need for your data?

   

  You can get a general estimate by taking the size of the items you want to cache and multiplying it by the number of items you want to keep in the cache at the same time\. To get a reasonable estimation of the item size, serialize your cache items then count the characters, then divide this over the number of shards in your cluster\.

   
+ What version of Redis are you running?

   

  Redis versions prior to 2\.8\.22 require you to reserve more memory for failover, snapshot, synchronizing, and promoting a replica to primary operations\. This requirement occurs because you must have sufficient memory available for all writes that occur during the process\. 

  Redis version 2\.8\.22 and later use a forkless save process that requires less available memory than the earlier process\.

  For more information, see the following:

  + [Ensuring You Have Sufficient Memory to Create a Redis Snapshot](BestPractices.BGSAVE.md)

   
+ How write\-heavy is your application?

   

  Write heavy applications can require significantly more available memory, memory not used by data, when taking snapshots or failing over\. Whenever the `BGSAVE` process is performed–when taking a snapshot, when syncing a primary cluster with a replica in a cluster, when enabling the append\-only file \(AOF\) feature, or promoting a replica to primary \(if you have Multi\-AZ with auto failover enabled\)–you must have sufficient memory that is unused by data to accommodate all the writes that transpire during the `BGSAVE` process\. Worst case would be when all of your data is rewritten during the process, in which case you would need a node instance size with twice as much memory as needed for data alone\.

   

  For more detailed information, see [Ensuring You Have Sufficient Memory to Create a Redis Snapshot](BestPractices.BGSAVE.md)\.

   
+ Will your implementation be a standalone Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster or a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster with multiple shards?

   

**Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster**  
If you're implementing a Redis \(cluster mode disabled\) cluster, your node type must be able to accommodate all your data plus the necessary overhead as described in the previous bullet\.

   

  For example, if you estimate that the total size of all your items to be 12 GB, you can use a `cache.m3.xlarge` node with 13\.3 GB of memory or a `cache.r3.large` node with 13\.5 GB of memory\. However, you may need more memory for `BGSAVE` operations\. If your application is write heavy, you should double the memory requirements to at least 24 GB, meaning you should use either a `cache.m3.2xlarge` with 27\.9 GB of memory or a `cache.r3.large` with 28\.4 GB of memory\.

   

**Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) with multiple shards**  
If you're implementing a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster with multiple shards, then the node type must be able to accommodate `bytes-for-data-and-overhead / number-of-shards` bytes of data\.

   

  For example, if you estimate that the total size of all your items to be 12 GB and you have 2 shards, you can use a `cache.m3.large` node with 6\.05 GB of memory \(12 GB / 2\)\. However, you may need more memory for `BGSAVE` operations\. If your application is write heavy, you should double the memory requirements to at least 12 GB per shard, meaning you should use either a `cache.m3.xlarge` with 13\.3 GB of memory or a `cache.r3.large` with 13\.5 GB of memory\.

   

  Currently you cannot add shards to a Redis \(cluster mode enabled\) cluster\. Therefore, you may want to use a somewhat larger node type to accommodate anticipated growth\.

   

While your cluster is running, you can monitor the memory usage, processor utilization, cache hits, and cache misses metrics that are published to CloudWatch\. If your cluster does not have the desired hit rate or you notice that keys are being evicted too often, you can choose a different node size with larger CPU and memory specifications\.

When monitoring CPU usage, remember that Redis is single\-threaded, so you need to multiply the reported CPU usage by the number of CPU cores to get that actual usage\. For example, a four core CPU reporting a 20% usage rate is actually the one core Redis is using running at 80%\.
