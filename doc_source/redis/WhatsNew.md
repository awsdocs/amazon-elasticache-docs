| Multi\-AZ support for Redis replication groups | ElastiCache adds support for Multi\-AZ from the primary node to a read replica in a Redis replication group\. ElastiCache monitors the health of the replication group\. If the primary fails, ElastiCache automatically promotes a replica to primary, then replaces the replica\. For more information, see [Minimizing Downtime in ElastiCache for Redis with Multi\-AZ](AutoFailover.md)\. |  October 24, 2014 | 
|  AWS CloudTrail logging of API calls supported  |  ElastiCache adds support for using AWS CloudTrail to log all ElastiCache API calls\. For more information, see [Logging Amazon ElastiCache API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.  |  September 15, 2014  | 
| New instance sizes supported |  ElastiCache adds support for additional General Purpose \(T2\) instances\. For more information, see [Configuring Engine Parameters Using Parameter Groups](ParameterGroups.md)\.  |  September 11, 2014  | 
| New instance sizes supported |  ElastiCache adds support for additional General Purpose \(M3\) instances and Memory Optimized \(R3\) instances\. For more information, see [Configuring Engine Parameters Using Parameter Groups](ParameterGroups.md)\.  |  July 1, 2014  | 
| Backup and restore for Redis clusters |  In this release, ElastiCache allows customers to create snapshots of their Redis clusters, and create new clusters using these snapshots\. A backup is a copy of the cluster at a specific moment in time, and consists of cluster metadata and all of the data in the Redis cache\. Backups are stored in Amazon S3, and customers can restore the data from a snapshot into a new cluster at any time\. For more information, see [Backup and Restore for ElastiCache for Redis ](backups.md)\.  |  April 24, 2014  | 
|  Redis 2\.8\.6  |  ElastiCache supports Redis 2\.8\.6, in addition to Redis 2\.6\.13\. With Redis 2\.8\.6, customers can improve the resiliency and fault tolerance of read replicas, with support for partial resynchronization, and a user\-defined minimum number of read replicas that must be available at all times\. Redis 2\.8\.6 also offers full support for publish\-and\-subscribe, where clients can be notified of events that occur on the server\.  | March 13, 2014 | 
|  Redis cache engine  |  ElastiCache offers Redis cache engine software, in addition to Memcached\. Customers who currently use Redis can "seed" a new ElastiCache Redis cache cluster with their existing data from a Redis snapshot file, easing migration to a managed ElastiCache environment\. To support Redis replication capabilities, the ElastiCache API now supports replication groups\. Customers can create a replication group with a primary Redis cache node, and add one or more read replica nodes that automatically stay synchronized with cache data in the primary node\. Read\-intensive applications can be offloaded to a read replica, reducing the load on the primary node\. Read replicas can also guard against data loss in the event of a primary cache node failure\.  |  September 3, 2013   | 
|  Support for default Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)  |  In this release, ElastiCache is fully integrated with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)\. For new customers, cache clusters are created in an Amazon VPC by default\. For more information, see [Amazon VPCs and ElastiCache Security](VPCs.md)\.  |  January 8, 2013   | 
|  Support for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)  |  In this release, ElastiCache clusters can be launched in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)\. By default, new customers' cache clusters are created in an Amazon VPC automatically; existing customers can migrate to Amazon VPC at their own pace\. For more information, see [Amazon VPCs and ElastiCache Security](VPCs.md)\.  | December 20, 2012  | 
|  New cache node types  |  This release provides four additional cache node types\.   | November 13, 2012 | 
|  Reserved cache nodes  |  This release adds support for reserved cache nodes\.   | April 5, 2012 | 
|  New guide  |  This is the first release of *Amazon ElastiCache User Guide*\.   | August 22, 2011 |
