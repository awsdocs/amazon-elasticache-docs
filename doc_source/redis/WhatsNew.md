| Backup and restore for Redis clusters |  In this release, ElastiCache allows customers to create snapshots of their Redis clusters, and create new clusters using these snapshots\. A backup is a copy of the cluster at a specific moment in time, and consists of cluster metadata and all of the data in the Redis cache\. Backups are stored in Amazon S3, and customers can restore the data from a snapshot into a new cluster at any time\.

|  Redis 2\.8\.6  |  ElastiCache supports Redis 2\.8\.6, in addition to Redis 2\.6\.13\. With Redis 2\.8\.6, customers can improve the resiliency and fault tolerance of read replicas, with support for partial resynchronization, and a user\-defined minimum number of read replicas that must be available at all times\. Redis 2\.8\.6 also offers full support for publish\-and\-subscribe, where clients can be notified of events that occur on the server\.  | March 13, 2014 | 
|  Redis cache engine  |  ElastiCache offers Redis cache engine software, in addition to Memcached\. Customers who currently use Redis can "seed" a new ElastiCache Redis cache cluster with their existing data from a Redis snapshot file, easing migration to a managed ElastiCache environment\. To support Redis replication capabilities, the ElastiCache API now supports replication groups\. Customers can create a replication group with a primary Redis cache node, and add one or more read replica nodes that automatically stay synchronized with cache data in the primary node\. Read\-intensive applications can be offloaded to a read replica, reducing the load on the primary node\. Read replicas can also guard against data loss in the event of a primary cache node failure\.  |  September 3, 2013   |
