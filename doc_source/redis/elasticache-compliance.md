## Self\-service security updates for compliance<a name="elasticache-compliance-self-service"></a>

ElastiCache offers a self\-service software update feature called **Service Updates** by using the console, API, and CLI\. Using this feature, you can manage security updates on your Redis clusters on\-demand and in real\-time\. This feature allows you to control when you update Redis clusters with the latest required security fixes, minimizing the impact on your business\.

Security updates are released by using the **Service Updates** feature\. They are specified by the **Update Type** field of value **security update**\. The Service Update has corresponding **Severity** and **Recommended Apply by Date** fields\. In order to maintain compliance of your Redis clusters, you must apply the available updates by the **Recommended Apply by Date**\. The field **SLA Met** reflects your Redis cluster’s compliance status\. 

**Note**  
If you do not apply the Service Update by the recommended date or when the Service Update expires, ElastiCache will not take any action to apply the update on your behalf\.  
You are notified of the Service Updates applicable to your Redis clusters by an announcement on the Redis console, email, Amazon SNS, CloudWatch events \(\(AWS Health Service\)\. For more information on Self\-Service Maintenance see [Service updates in ElastiCache for Redis](Self-Service-Updates.md)\.   
   
CloudWatch events and AWS Health Dashboard are not supported in the following regions:  
us\-gov\-west\-1 
us\-gov\-east\-1
cn\-north\-1
cn\-northwest\-1

## ElastiCache for Redis FedRAMP compliance<a name="elasticache-compliance-fedramp"></a>

The AWS FedRAMP Compliance program includes Amazon ElastiCache for Redis as a FedRAMP\-authorized service\. If you are a federal or commercial customer, you can use the service to process and store sensitive workloads in AWS US East and US West with data up to the moderate impact level\. You can use the service for sensitive workloads in the AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region’s authorization boundary with data up to the high impact level\.

You can request access to the AWS FedRAMP Security Packages through the FedRAMP PMO or your AWS Sales Account Manager or, they can be downloaded through **AWS Artifact** at [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/)\.

**Requirements**

To enable FedRAMP support on your ElastiCache for Redis cluster, your cluster and nodes within the cluster must satisfy the following requirements\.
+ **Engine version requirements** – Your cluster must be running ElastiCache for Redis 3\.2\.6, 4\.0\.10, 7\.0 and later for both cluster mode enabled and disabled to qualify for FedRAMP compliance\.
  + Starting with ElastiCache for Redis versions 3\.2\.6, note that versions of 3\.x are ready for [Redis versions end of life schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/deprecated-engine-versions.html)\. For clusters running versions 4\.0\.10, 7\.0 and later for both cluster mode enabled and disabled, you can also enable additional data security features such as:
    + [ElastiCache in\-transit encryption \(TLS\)](in-transit-encryption.md)
    + [At\-Rest Encryption in ElastiCache for Redis](at-rest-encryption.md)
    + [Authenticating with the Redis AUTH command](auth.md)
+ **Node type requirements** – Your cluster must be running a current\-generation node type — M4, M5, M6g, T2, T3, T4g, R4, R5 or R6g\. For more information, see the following: 
  + [Supported node types](CacheNodes.SupportedTypes.md)
  + [Choosing your node size](nodes-select-size.md#CacheNodes.SelectSize)
+ **FIPS Endpoints requirements** – Your ElastiCache for Redis clusters can be created using the FIPS endpoints available in the following regions:\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/elasticache-compliance.html)
+ **Security Updates Requirement** – You must regularly update your Redis cluster by the **Recommended Apply by Date**\. You can update the cluster in real\-time and on\-demand to ensure no impact to your business\. For more information, see [Service updates in ElastiCache for Redis](Self-Service-Updates.md)\.

## HIPAA eligibility<a name="elasticache-compliance-hipaa"></a>

The AWS HIPAA Compliance program includes Amazon ElastiCache for Redis as a HIPAA eligible service\.

To use ElastiCache for Redis in compliance with HIPAA, you need to set up a Business Associate Agreement \(BAA\) with AWS\. In addition, your cluster and the nodes within your cluster must satisfy the requirements for engine version, node type, and data security listed following\.

**Requirements**

To enable HIPAA support on your ElastiCache for Redis cluster, your cluster and nodes within the cluster must satisfy the following requirements\.
+ **Engine version requirements** – Your cluster must be running one of the following ElastiCache for Redis versions to qualify for HIPAA eligibility\.
  + [ElastiCache for Redis version 7\.0 \(enhanced\)](supported-engine-versions.md#redis-version-7.0) or higher\.
  + [ElastiCache for Redis version 6\.0 \(enhanced\)](supported-engine-versions.md#redis-version-6.0) or higher\.
  + [ElastiCache for Redis version 5\.0\.6 \(enhanced\)](supported-engine-versions.md#redis-version-5-0.6) or higher\.
  + [ElastiCache for Redis version 4\.0\.10 \(enhanced\)](supported-engine-versions.md#redis-version-4-0-10) or higher\.
  + [ElastiCache for Redis version 3\.2\.10 \(enhanced\)](supported-engine-versions.md#redis-version-3-2-10) or higher\.
**Important**  
ElastiCache for Redis versions running 3\.x are reaching their End of Life \(EOL\) schedule\. For more information, see [Redis versions end of life schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/deprecated-engine-versions.html)\.
+ **Node type requirements** – Your cluster must be running a current\-generation node type— M4, M5, M6g, T2, T3, T4g, R4, R5, R6g or R6gd\. For more information, see the following:

## Create and seed a new compliant cluster<a name="elasticache-compliance-create-cluster"></a>

To create a compliant cluster, create a new cluster and make sure that your choices fulfill the requirements for the compliance you want\. These requirements can include engine version, node type, encryption, and if needed FIPS endpoints\. If you choose, you can seed a new compliant cluster with data from an existing cluster as you're creating it\. For more information, see the following:
+ [Creating a cluster](Clusters.Create.md)
+ [Creating a Redis replication group from scratch](Replication.CreatingReplGroup.NoExistingCluster.md)
+ [Seeding a new cluster with an externally created backup](backups-seeding-redis.md)
