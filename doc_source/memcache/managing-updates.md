# Managing the service updates<a name="managing-updates"></a>

ElastiCache service updates are released on a regular basis\. If you have one or more qualifying cache clusters for those service updates, you receive notifications through email, SNS, the Personal Health Dashboard \(PHD\), and Amazon CloudWatch events\. The updates are also displayed on the **Service Updates** page on the ElastiCache console\. 

However, you control when to apply an update, regardless of the recommendation\. At a minimum, we strongly recommend that you apply any updates of type **security** to ensure that your Memcached clusters are always up\-to\-date with current security patches\. 

For more information, see [Amazon ElastiCache maintenance help page](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/elasticache-maintenance/)\.

The following sections explore these options in detail\.
